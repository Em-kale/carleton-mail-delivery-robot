Static RSSI to meters

Experiment design:
- Place the Raspberry Pi in a static location on one end of a hallway
- Run a script to collect rolling average for the RSSI of a target beacon
- Place the beacon at several known distances away from the Raspberry Pi
- Record rolling average measurement with the beacon at the same level as the robot and a second as close to ceiling level as possible at a known height
    - Pause between measurements for the rolling average to settle
- Repeat for a second beacon

Analysis:
- Compare RSSI values to known distances, paying close attention to the height differences
- 

Results:

1m height difference, next to metal window
